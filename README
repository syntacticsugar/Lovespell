My eyes opened to Ruby for the very first time when, on a flight from New York to Los Angeles I discovered the Ruby ternary operator.  The ternary operator is common to many language, but its compactness of logic was an alluring concept for me, and that night I started to learn about the object oriented world of Ruby.  The following night, I wrote my first Ruby script, "Lovespell".  It doesn't use any ternary operators, though.
